# AppraiserBFF Back-end

## General Project Information: 
Pitch: Train a housing prediction model using Zillow housing data and then create a web app where users can fill out a form about their home attributes and get an estimated sale price.

MVP: Train a linear regression model on Kaggle Zillow data. Web interface allows for imputting all relevant data and app reports a price prediction. 

Stretch Goal: Modeling uses more sophisticated approaches than linear regression. App also reports confidence in making the prediction, generates predictions with only partial home information provided.

## Back-end:
I'll be working on making an API for the front-end. First, I'll have to receive data from the data science model. I'll then be sending that over to the front-end via an internal API for the web app.
